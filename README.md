# Movie-Ratings

## Description
This is a still-in-development Movie-Ratings app with complete back end functionality, including a database with movie and user tables, authorization middleware and an admin dashboard for adding movie data. It's built with node.js packages: sequelize, express, bcrypt, jsonwebtoken, and pg for interacting with PostgreSQL. Users who signup can leave ratings and reviews on movies. Eventually, a user groups feature will be added to allow users to form groups with other users.
