# Movie-Ratings

## Description
This is a still-in-development Movie Ratings app with complete back end functionality, including a database with movie and user tables, authorization middleware and an admin dashboard for adding movie data. Integration with The Movie Database (TMDB) API provides movie detail data, ratings and reviews. It's built with node.js packages: sequelize, express, bcrypt, jsonwebtoken and pg for interacting with PostgreSQL. 

Users who signup can leave ratings and reviews on movies. Eventually, user reviews from TMDB (themoviedb.org) will be integrated through the API. Additional developments to come in the near future. 

## Developer Notes 
The CSS library Bulma was used for shaping the style and layout, which will also be updated in the near future.
